# Interactive-Form-2023
  Use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.
  Will add JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
