# Interactive-Form-2023
  Use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.
  Will add JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.


- EXTRA CREDIT: 

2. Real-time Error Message - The CVV Code field is programmed to listen for a keyup user interaction. When the user interaction occurs, validation check for that input is ran.

3. Conditional Error Message - For Zip Code field, provide one error message if the field fails for not having correct number of digits, and a separate message if it fails due to having characters that are not digits.
